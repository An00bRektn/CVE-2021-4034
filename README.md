# CVE-2021-4034
> January 25, 2022 | An00bRektn

This is a golang implementation of CVE-2021-4034 based on (*read as:* blatantly stolen from) [clubby789's](https://github.com/clubby789/CVE-2021-4034) implementation of the vulnerability discovered by [Qualys](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/01/25/pwnkit-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-discovered-in-polkits-pkexec-cve-2021-4034).

I made a blog post going into further detail about the vulnerability, mainly for myself, but for anyone who wants a more drawn out explanation, which you can find [here](https://an00brektn.github.io/pwnkit/).

## FAQ

#### How are you doing?
Good, thanks for asking ðŸ˜Š

#### Did you discover this vulnerability?
No. This was from Qualys. Did you not read the first part?

#### Why clubby789?
Saw them create a new repository in my GitHub feed and decided I'd try to recreate it in another language (yes I have nothing better to do).

#### Why Golang? Shouldn't you just use C?
I just wanted to get some more Golang practice in. Also, currently not smart enough to figure out the exact details of the vuln without looking at a PoC. I get it now, but I needed to copy the code to understand the code.

#### Who asked?
idk
